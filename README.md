# TwitterWebScraper
Scrapes @ESPNCFB and counts the number of times it mentions selected football teams.


TO START:
  
  1. DOWNLOAD "TwitterApp.zip"
  
  2. UNZIP file
  
  3. DOWNLOAD "twitter4j-4.0.7" API from this repository OR at http://twitter4j.org/en/
  
  4. ADD the twitter4j .jar to your IDE (I used NetBeans 8.2) Help/Tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBugSwSocHY
  
  5. OPEN "TwitterApp" project in your IDE
  
  6. RUN "TwitterApp"
    a. IF you are prompted to "Reslove issues" click "Resolve". Then navigate to where you downloaded the twitter4j-4.0.7 API and select          it. This will import the twitter4j library and allow the application to run correctly.
    
  7. Once the app is run select either "Top 25" or "Big Ten" in the drop down and CLICK "Generate". The page will reload with the most up       to date number of mentions from @ESPNCFB's Twitter page for each team.
